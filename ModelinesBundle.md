Inserts two modelines with the currently active filetype and tabulator settings.

Can be used for:

  * a quick overview of the file settings (like is the file dos or unix format).
  * to set the file setting (just change the settings which are wrong).
  * to make shure the file settings stay put when the file is saved and loaded.

Can be easily exdended for more settings - just as you want it.
