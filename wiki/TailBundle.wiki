#labels Featured,Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

= Details =

This Tail plug-in combines the ideas from [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1374 vimscript#1374] and [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1692 vimscript#1692] into one plugin offereing both preview and tabed tail functionality. I also added shortcut mapping to "set wrap" and "set number" - which both can be useful when observing log files. 

Last not least I use the new Vim 7.0 autoload feature so this script should load faster and use less memory.
