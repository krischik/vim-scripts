= Details =

This Tail plug-in combines the ideas from vimscript#1374 and vimscript#1692 into one plugin offereing both preview and tabed tail functionality. I also added shortcut mapping to "set wrap" and "set number" - which both can be useful when observing log files. 

Last not least I use the new Vim 7.0 autoload feature so this script should load faster and use less memory then there vimscript#1374 and vimscript#1692.
